I am writing in order to do my first homework.  

This activity involves install "LaTex", "rmarkdown" and add some codes.  

I am not sure about the purpose of Latex or rmarkdown because I was able to create a new file on R Markdown before intalling it and I do not know how to use LaTex properly.  

However, I believe that all of this is really important. Otherwise, Umberto would not ask us for it.  

```{r echo = FALSE}
a = seq(1:10)  
b = a*a  
plot(a, b)
plot(a, b)
```
